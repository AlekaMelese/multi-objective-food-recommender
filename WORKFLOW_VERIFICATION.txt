✅ Section 2.2: Baseline Model (Lines 63-83)
   - "Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)"
   - "Optimizes solely for rating prediction"
   - "R ≈ W × H"

✅ Section 2.3: Multi-Objective Model (Lines 85-101)
   - "Score(u, i) = α · Preference(u, i) + (1 - α) · Health(i)"
   - "Tested α values: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0"

✅ Section 3.1-3.2: Results (Lines 121-139)
   - Baseline: Test RMSE 3.6491

   - "Avg Health Score (Top-10): Average WHO health score"

✅ Section 3.3: Top-K Recommendation Quality (Lines 141-151)
   - Complete table with Precision@10, Recall@10, F1-Score
   - Avg Health (Top-10): 0.9137 (α=0.0) to 0.6005 (α=1.0)

✅ Section 3.5: Visualizations (Lines 167-175)
   - "Figure 1: Pareto Curve (plots/pareto_curve.png)"
   - "Shows trade-off frontier between preference accuracy and health"
   - "Figure 2: Alpha Comparison"

✅ Implementation:
   - File: src/6_topk_evaluation.py

REQUIRED:
✓ Discuss risks of nudging behavior (over-restriction vs. freedom of choice)
✓ Describe how personalization fairness varies across dietary preference groups

REPORT COVERAGE:
✅ Section 4.3: Ethical Considerations and Responsible AI (Lines 211-253)

   ✅ "Risks of Nudging Behavior: Over-Restriction vs. Freedom of Choice"
      - "Over-Restriction Risk (Low α): ...paternalistic decision-making"
      - "Freedom of Choice (High α): ...enable unhealthy eating patterns"
      - "Balance: α = 0.5...who decides the 'right' balance?"

   ✅ "Personalization Fairness Across Dietary Preference Groups"
      - "Cultural Dietary Preferences: WHO scores reflect Western guidelines"
      - "Medical Conditions: harmful for diabetics, kidney patients, allergies"

      - Personalized health profiles
      - Transparent explanations
      - Fairness monitoring
