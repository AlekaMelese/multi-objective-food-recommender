INSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS - COMPLETE CHECKLIST
================================================================================

✅ = COMPLETED
❌ = MISSING

================================================================================
1. DATA PREPROCESSING (Instructions: Lines 13-17)
================================================================================

✅ Remove recipes missing nutritional or rating information
   → Filtered from 703 to 281 recipes with complete data

✅ Normalize ratings and health scores
   → Ratings: [1,5] → [0,1] using (rating - 1) / 4
   → Health scores: Already in [0,1]

✅ Split into train/validation/test
   → 80% train (22,792 ratings)
   → 10% val (2,849 ratings)
   → 10% test (2,850 ratings)
   → Method: Random split (justified in report)

✅ Compute user average health preference baseline
   → Average user health preference: 0.5990
   → Added to report Section 2.1

================================================================================
2. MODEL DEVELOPMENT (Instructions: Lines 18-23)
================================================================================

✅ Baseline Model: Matrix Factorization optimized for rating prediction
   → Implemented: NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)
   → File: src/3_baseline_model_sklearn.py
   → Test RMSE: 3.6491

✅ Multi-Objective Model: Combine preference P(u,i) with health H(i)
   → Formula: Score(u,i) = α·P(u,i) + (1-α)·H(i)
   → File: src/4_multiobjective_model.py

✅ Experiment with multiple α values (0.0 → 1.0)
   → Tested: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0
   → Results saved: results/multiobjective_results.json

================================================================================
3. EVALUATION (Instructions: Lines 24-28)
================================================================================

✅ Recommendation Quality: Precision, Recall
   → Precision@10: 0.0041 to 0.0056 across α values
   → Recall@10: 0.0349 to 0.0485 across α values
   → F1-Score: 0.0073 to 0.0100 across α values
   → File: src/6_topk_evaluation.py
   → Results: results/topk_evaluation.json

✅ Healthfulness of recommendations: Avg. who_score_normalized of Top-K
   → Top-10 Health Score: 0.9137 (α=0.0) to 0.6005 (α=1.0)
   → Shows 52% health reduction from health-focus to preference-focus
   → Included in Section 3.3 of report

✅ Generate a Pareto curve demonstrating trade-offs
   → File: plots/pareto_curve.png (125KB)
   → Shows RMSE vs Health Score trade-off
   → File: plots/alpha_comparison.png (145KB)
   → Generated by: src/5_evaluate_visualize.py

================================================================================
4. RESPONSIBLE AI ANALYSIS (Instructions: Lines 29-31)
================================================================================

✅ Discuss risks of nudging behavior (over-restriction vs. freedom of choice)
   → Report Section 4.3: Ethical Considerations
   → Covers: Paternalism, User Autonomy, Fairness, Transparency
   → Recommendation: User-controllable α with opt-out option

✅ Describe how personalization fairness varies across dietary preference groups
   → Report Section 4.3: Cultural sensitivity and medical conditions
   → Report Section 4.4: Limitations of WHO scores for diverse populations

================================================================================
EXPECTED DELIVERABLES (Instructions: Lines 32-38)
================================================================================

✅ Python code & environment file
   → src/3_baseline_model_sklearn.py
   → src/4_multiobjective_model.py
   → src/5_evaluate_visualize.py
   → src/6_topk_evaluation.py
   → requirements.txt

✅ Performance comparison tables and Pareto-front visualizations
   → Tables in REPORT.md:
      • Section 3.1: Baseline Model Performance
      • Section 3.2: Multi-Objective Model Performance
      • Section 3.3: Top-K Recommendation Quality ← NEW
   → Visualizations:
      • plots/pareto_curve.png
      • plots/alpha_comparison.png

✅ Short report (3–4 pages):
   → File: REPORT.md (currently ~6 pages, can be condensed)

   ✅ Model description & results
      → Section 2: Methodology (all models described)
      → Section 3: Results (all metrics included)

   ✅ Interpretation of trade-offs
      → Section 3.4: Key Findings
      → Section 4.1: Interpretation of Results

   ✅ Discussion on ethical implications of health nudging
      → Section 4.3: Ethical Considerations
      → Section 4.2: Practical Implications
