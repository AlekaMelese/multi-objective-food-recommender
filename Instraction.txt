Project 1: Multi-Objective Food Recommendation Balancing User Preference and Healthiness
Goal and Motivation
Traditional recommender systems optimize only for user preference, which may unintentionally promote foods high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. This project develops a multi-objective recommender that simultaneously optimizes:
•User taste preference
•WHO-aligned health score (who_score)
This project strengthens understanding of responsible personalization in the context of chronic disease prevention and sustainable, long-term well-being.
Dataset Description (HUMMUS)
You will use:
•Recipe Metadata File: Contains nutritional features, health category, ingredients, etc.
•User Interaction File: (member_id, recipe_id, rating) user ratings.
Key nutritional fields: totalFat, saturatedFat, sugars, sodium, protein, calories, who_score This enables computing explicit health-awareness objectives.
Assigned Tasks / Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
•Remove recipes missing nutritional or rating information.
•Normalize ratings and health scores.
•Split into train/validation/test (time-aware or random split; justify your choice).
•Compute user average health preference baseline.
2. Model Development
Implement two models:
1.Baseline: Matrix Factorization / SVD or a Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model optimized for rating prediction.
2.Multi-Objective Model: Combine preference score P(𝑢,𝑖) with health score H(i) Example trade-off function:
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑢,𝑖)=𝛼⋅𝑃(𝑢,𝑖)+(1−𝛼)⋅𝐻(𝑖)
Experiment with multiple α values (e.g., 0.0 → 1.0).
3. Evaluation
Evaluate trade-offs:
•Recommendation Quality: Precision, Recall
•Healthfulness of recommendations: Avg. who_score_normalized of Top-K
•Generate a Pareto curve demonstrating trade-offs.
4. Responsible AI Analysis
•Discuss risks of nudging behavior (over-restriction vs. freedom of choice).
•Describe how personalization fairness varies across dietary preference groups.
Expected Deliverables
•Python code & environment file
•Performance comparison tables and Pareto-front visualizations
•Short report (3–4 pages):
oModel description & results
oInterpretation of trade-offs
oDiscussion on ethical implications of health nudging
